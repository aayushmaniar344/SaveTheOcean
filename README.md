I think that my web page best fits in the category of "Best Impact"


Note to Judges:
Hello, My name is Aayush Maniar and I'm an incoming freshman at Conant High School. I have never worked with code before so I was learning html and CSS as I was doing my project. I thought that it was a great experience and I would love to do it again. OVer the course of this project, I learned to never give up, work hard, and stay dedicated. I was thinking of not doing this in the beginning but I stayed with it and I ended up learning a lot. This topic is one that I have always though about, and I was excited when I found out I could share my opinion with others. Thank you so much for this awesome oppurtunity!
