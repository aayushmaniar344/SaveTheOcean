                The ocean has forever been the vast and never-ending paradise, but now thanks to pollution, it is on the verge of becoming destroyed.
                Pollution has impacted the ocean more than we can imagine. Habitats are being destroyed, Coral Reefs are decaying, and countless
                lives are being lost every day. We humans, are the ones to blame for all of this. Our carelessness truly has made the oceans a dangerous and miserable
                place for all sea life. <br /> There are many human behaviors that have led to this problem. For one, acidifying oceans has caused Coral Reef skeletons to
                break down at a rapid pace. Fish use these skeletons as habitats so they are left with no home. In Florida, the only tropical Coral Reef in the continental United States,
                is disintegrating faster than scientists predicted. This is a growing concern because as the climate warms up, acidification occurs as the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from
                the atmosphere. This could have a lasting affect on the ocean. Additionally, using personal care products has really impacted the health of marin life. For example,
                people use sunscreen to make sure that they protect the skin. However, they don't realize that the sunscreen actually has many dangerous chemicals that affects
                the life inside of the ocean. The chemical is called Oxybenzone. It is released into the ocean from a swimmers' skin, or through chemicals transported in our sewage systems. Lasty, pollution can affect humans as well.
                There has been microplastic found inside of liquids and food that we consume. This is not healthy for our bodies because plastic is not supposed to enter our body at all.
                There are many other harmful behaviors that have impacted marine life that we don't know of but it is not too late to turn it around.<br />

            <p>
                Plastic that ends up in the ocean is the biggest problem that marine life faces. In the past 100 years, humans have produced more plastic than ever before. This is due to
                the increase in production for many things. Plastic kills marine mammals, sea turtles, and many other kinds of life in the ocean. Animals mistake plastic as food, and they
                end up eating it. For example, plastic bags can look like jellyfish so predetors are tricked into eating them. As a result, plastic is found in many dead animals' stomaches.
                For example, when a whale washed up on shore in the Phillippines, 40 pounds of plastic wsa found in it. This can be devestaing for many animals and too much plastic can most likely lead to
                death. Additionally, plastic doesn't just end up in hungry stomaches, it can also end up suffocating many animals. The marine creatures get tangled up with the plastic, and they can't escape so they
                become suffocated. Overall, plastic confuses the animals so they mistake it for food, and it can suffocate the animals if they get tangled.<br />

                When pollutants enter the water, they speed the growth of damaging algeas, and they lower the water quiality. However, most importantly, they make coral reefs more susceptable to disease and they prevent them from growing at
                their normal rate. Also, pollution has damaged life in the reef. Many fish and other living organisms are impacted by decaying reefs. They depend on them for a safe habitat and a source of food. Additionally,
                our changing climate has greatly impacted the state of our coral reefs. This is because bleeching occurs, which really lowers the health of the reefs. As a result of all of this, more than 50% of coral reefs have died in
                the last 30 years and 90% may die in the upcoming century. Though most of the damage comes from climate change and pollution, overfishing is also part og the reason that the reefs are deteriorating. Overfishing has affected the fish population in
                the reefs and without the fish, the entire food chain gets unbalanced. All in all, coral reefs are getting worse and worse, and if we don't do anything now, soon there will be no colorful wonders in the ocean. <br />

            <p>
                Though it may seem as if the ocean is already getting destroyed, there is still a way to turn this around. We as humans, need to come together
                and help the oceans. We can do this in many ways. Probably the most effective way to reduce plastic pollution in the ocean, is to simply
                aviod using plastic materials. Instead of using a plastic waterbottle at baseball practice, use a resuable one as an alternative. Instead of using the plastic bags
                that the store provide, bring your own bag when shopping. There are many other ways you can reduce your plastic usage, but humans need to have the desire to save the oceans and
                they need to be more aware of what they do. Another way to reduce pollution is to reduce your carbon footprint. Climate change is also a very important aspect that contributes to the poor state of the ocean.
                When you reduce your carbon footprint, bleeching doesn't occur in the ocean. As a result, marine life can flourish. You can drive electric cars instead of ones that require gas or you can use more electric-powered products.
                The possibilities are endless. Additionally, you can support efferts to protect the ocean. You can donate to the cause, or you could even volunteer to clean up trash. Overall, anyway that you are helping contribute to the cause, just know that
                you are doing your part as a human being. We all can help, but it is our choice if we choose to.
